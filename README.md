Simple dynamic wallpaper script for setting GNOME desktop wallpaper based on
time of day. The appropriate image in images/ named `(HOUR).png` is chosen at
every time the script is called.

The script only sets the wallpaper and depends on cron to run regularly.

## Attribution

Default collection of wallpapers in images/ are taken from _The 25th Hour_ by
[Louis Coyle](http://louie.co.nz/). The animation was played in full screen in
Google Chrome with photos taken at 1 to 2s intervals (highly irregular and
manual).

Images are NOT part of the MIT Licence. Only the scripts are.

Inspired by [dynamic-wallpaper](https://github.com/adi1090x/dynamic-wallpaper),
but I wanted something that worked as a cron job instead of constantly running.

## Usage

### cron

Firstly, identify some program that is guaranteed to be running in a GNOME
session. This might be `gnome-session` itself, or a compositor like `picom` or
`compton`. Then, replace `GSESSION_PROGRAM=compton` in dynwall.sh with your
program, like so: `GSESSION_PROGRAM=<your program>`.

This is required because when run by cron, we need to use some trickery
to get the `DBUS_SESSION_BUSADDRESS` in order to use gsettings to set the
wallpaper.

Add the following line to your crontab:

```
1 * * * * /path/to/dynwall/dynwall.sh
```

We set the job to run at minute 1, so that there is no chance of any mistake
with cron triggering the job just before the hour and `date +"%H"` returning the
previous hour.

Since cron only runs this at the start of every hour, **you should also call
dynwall by adding dynwall to your startup applications** suitable for
your desktop environment. If you do not, the wallpaper will not be properly set
at login. For example, if you are using i3, run it with exec in your i3config.

To trigger manually, run dynwall.sh directly. The cron job will ensure it
updates every hour.

### watch (untested)

If using watch or some other program to call the script regularly, there is no
need to set `GSESSION_PROGRAM`. Simply add something like

```
watch -n 300 /path/to/dynwall/dynwall.sh
```

to some init file (not tested).

## Custom wallpapers

Simply fill the images folder with your choice of wallpapers from 00.png to
23.png, corresponding to the hour you want them to appear. Symlinks are allowed;
in fact the default ones are symlinks to a collection of screenshots in
images/all.

## Dependencies

- GNOME based desktop environment
